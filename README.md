Nextion Remote for Domoticz or any other home automation server

Using a Nextion 3.5 inch display and a Esp8266 to controll vertial switches in Domoticz and read data back.

Currently this firmware can controll switches and Dimmers
And will report the battery status of the remote back to domoticz for monitoring.

Please keep in mind this is still a work in progress 

page added free for anybody to use

but pleade if any improvements are made please share them with the community !!!!!!


Nextion Graphics file the photoshop template and the arduino code are all provided 

The firmware uses wifi manager to connect to the wifi network the first time 
Once ota update is enabled on the display.
The esp will host a web server on its ip where you can upload a new firmware file to.
Please keep in mine please compile the firmware with sufficiant file storage so it can actualy save the fiel for flashing later on
